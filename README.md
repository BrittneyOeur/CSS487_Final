# CSS487 Final
## What I was trying to accomplish:
This project aimed to identify different chips (DS/3DS) of the Animal Crossing series. My goals for this project were image recognition, feature matching, and accuracy and precision.<br>
<br>**Image Recognition:**<br>
I wanted it to be able to detect the specific object I was looking for and be able to differentiate it from the other items shown in the scene images I provided.<br>
<br>**Feature Matching:**<br>
I wanted to be able to match the features of the images, this entailed extracting and matching key features present in the images of these chips. I wanted to establish correspondences between key points from different chip images to facilitate accurate results.<br>
<br>**Accuracy and Precision:**<br>
I wanted to achieve a high level of accuracy and precision in the identification process. This involves ensuring that my code was able to distinguish between different chip variants, even when faced with variations in lighting conditions, angles, or scales.<br>

## Methods implemented:
